# 🍾 Bottle Shooter – Gesture Controlled Game with Vision Create

## 🎮 Overview

Bottle Shooter is a gesture-controlled shooting game where you hit bottles using only your hand movements, tracked in real time via webcam.
Raise your index finger to fire bullets – no keyboard, mouse, or controller needed!

This project was built for a hackathon to showcase the use of computer vision + AI hand tracking in an interactive and fun way.
